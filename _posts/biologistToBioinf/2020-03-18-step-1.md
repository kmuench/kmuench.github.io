You may very well have a hypothesis you want to test, and a dataset in hand already. If not – that’s great news! 

You don’t need an existing research project to start learning - re-analyzing or replicating the results in a published paper is always a good way to start. It’ll help double-check your code (and double-check the authors as well) to compare your output to peer-reviewed results.

If you intend to collect your own data, spend some time defining your research question, and think about what the most appropriate assay for the task will be. Are you interested in looking at differential gene expression, but indifferent about splice variants? In that case, you might save your lab thousands of dollars by collecting 3’-Seq rather than mRNA-Seq data. Do you care more about collecting a large number of cells for your single cell sequencing experiment, or profiling each cell thoroughly with deep coverage? How many biological replicates to you need? All of these questions deserve a thorough Googling.

<p class="message">
  <b>PRO TIP:</b> I highly recommend that you do not collect samples or data for your own sequencing experiment before you have done two things:

* Establish what results you expect to see in your data, even if it is just an expression change in a handful of genes – this will act as a sanity check, and ensure you aren’t investing in a dataset that will yield nothing.
* Truly consider how to craft a batch effect-minimizing experimental design, preferably with the help of an experienced bioinformatician. Every step of the experiment - from the method with which samples are collected, to the day on which the library is prepared - has the potential to introduce batch effects that could render your $10,000 experiment uninterpretable. It happens! It really does!
