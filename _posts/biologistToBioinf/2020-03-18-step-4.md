Here is a sad but ironclad truth: experience beats classes every time. 

I truly believe there is no book, online tutorial, or workplace training that imbue you with code skills better or faster than just working on your project.Classes might help you get a sense for the basics, but 99% of people forget everything they learn unless they immediately apply it to a project. 

I wish it weren't so! Classes provide certainty - do X, acquire Y. Check the box, then level up. With the exception of . Andy Fire's Python class at Stanford, classes just end up leaving the people around me with disappointment, and a vague sense that they *used* to be able to code.

Troubleshooting is your best teacher. True learning comes from repeatedly Googling “How to sum subset of rows of a matrix in R”. Believe it.

(Note that this is why it helps to pick a project that you care about in Step One!)

Now on to [Step Five](), or return to the [Overview](https://kmuench.github.io/2020/03/18/ten-steps-to-bioinf/).
