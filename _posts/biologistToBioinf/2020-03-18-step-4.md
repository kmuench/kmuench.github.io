Here is a sad but ironclad truth: experience beats classes every time. 

I truly believe there is no book, online tutorial, or workplace training that imbue you with code skills better or faster than just working on your project. Classes might help you get a sense for the basics, but 99% of people forget everything they learn unless they immediately apply it to a project. 

I wish it weren't so! Alas, troubleshooting is your best teacher. True learning comes from repeatedly Googling “How to sum subset of rows of a matrix in R”. Believe it.

(Note that this is why it helps to pick a project that you care about in Step One!)
