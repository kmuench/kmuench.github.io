title: 6. Pay attention to error messages.

In the course of writing your pipeline, you will Google many mysterious error messages. In fact, it will be tempting to just copy/paste the text into Google without actually reading it. In most cases, you will have no other recourse, because the error messages will be gobbledegook.

However, I invite you meditate for a moment about what the error message is saying. Can you glean any clues from the gobbledegook? Is it pointing to specific lines in your code that broke? What does it mean when it says “incompatible type”? Or “object not found“? Asking those questions can help you learn what first troubleshooting steps you can take.

Learning what error messages are associated with what kinds of mistakes will be critical to making your troubleshooting faster.
