title: From Biologist to Bioinformatician in Ten Worthwhile Steps
---

It’s finally happened. You have an experimental biology question, but don’t know where to start your research. Traditional techniques have lost their luster, or you’re hungry to learn something new. The papers you read make claims you feel powerless to interpret. Maybe your advisor is making you do it. Maybe it’s your reviewer’s fault. Maybe Excel just crashed one too many times. <i>(Special March 2020 edit: Maybe you’re just plain quarantined and need something to do until your keycard works again!)</i>

One way or another, you’ve decided to learn bioinformatics.

Congratulations! I am truly, genuinely thrilled for you. You are about to embark on an exciting journey that will unlock brand new problem-solving skills and fresh insights into science. You are going to delight and amaze your coworkers with your head-turning graphs, nuanced insights, and creative hypothesis formation. Your future self will feel forever indebted to you and your wise choice to familiarize yourself with this particular toolbox.

That said, it’s absolutely normal to feel afraid. This journey will have many twists and turns. This path is not just a learning curve, but a perpetual upward climb.

You will spend many hours Googling answers to fix basic mistakes (this, you will find, is a critical and ever-present part of the process). You will feel perpetually surrounded by people who wrote their thesis on the tools you are struggling to grasp (this, too, is unavoidable in a field that is both wide and deep). You will spend a gear-grinding year getting good at single cell RNA-Seq, wander into a talk on the limitations of transcriptomics, and leave questioning every professional choice you have ever made. 

But here’s the thing: you can learn basic bioinformatics. This is true regardless of your programming background or your middle school math grades. However far you choose to hike up Mount Bioinformatics, you will gain clear-eyed, fresh perspectives that will distinguish you as a scientist and as a colleague. With effort and time - the same ingredients that made you the biologist you are today - you can become bilingual in both computational and benchside biology.

The first challenge you will face is an abundance of resources and advice. Where do you begin? Should you find an online class, or try to join a seminar series? What will actually be important to know down the line? In short - what is the best use of your time?

I have spent years teaching bioinformatics both to myself and to a diverse set of other biologists. What follows is the approach that seems to work the best for a wide variety of people. Though the strategy below might feel like a long and difficult process, following these steps will help you learn the most important features as quickly as possible.

Given my own background, it is geared towards those learning transcriptomics (e.g., RNA-Seq) but these principles are broadly applicable. I promise they will continue to be useful for any type of computational biology skill you acquire down the line.

Without further ado - those steps are:

1. [Find a project that you care about.](https://kmuench.github.io/2020/03/18/step-1/)
2. [Commit to one approach (at first).]()
3. [Decide if you want to code.]()
4. [Start prototyping.]()
5. [Use Github for version control.]()
6. [Pay attention to error messages.]()
7. [Do the vignettes.]()
9. [Ask for help.]()
9. [Manage frustration.]()
10. [Refine your prototype.]()

Use your powers wisely and well!
