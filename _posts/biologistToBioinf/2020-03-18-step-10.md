Once youâ€™ve written your first pipeline through, take time to reflect on it. You may finally have a visualization or a list of hits, but the real work is just beginning.

List the assumptions made by your pipeline. Does any of the software you use assume, for example, that you have an equal number of samples in each condition? Does one algorithm perform best with hundreds of samples, and poorly with only three?

Read papers that ask questions similar to yours. What tools are they using? Are there pieces of your pipeline with superior alternatives, or that better meet the specific requirements of your data?

Seek feedback on your methods and results from practicing computational biologists. Do they have suggestions, or recommendations for best practices?

Now that you have a prototype, refining your pipeline to find the best possible version will be much easier.

Well done! Return to the [overview](https://kmuench.github.io/2020/03/18/ten-steps-to-bioinf/) and congratulate yourself.
