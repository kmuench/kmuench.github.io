A lot of biologists - myself included - waste a lot of time trying to plan out the “correct” pipeline rather than just coding something up. In fact, there is usually no “correct” pipeline - and there are often multiple different, valid approaches one can use for any given problem.

When I started my transcriptomics career, I would drop one software pipeline as soon as I got a whiff that something else might be better. Cuffdiff is the past*? Abandon the project halfway through and switch to edgeR! Of course, I quickly discovered that there was no single right way to do things - only dozens of people with strong opinions on the particular way to tailor your analysis for your specific purpose. As a consequence, I wasted a lot of time half-learning techniques, growing steadily more discouraged as I had nothing to show for my hours of work. It wasn’t until I committed to writing a complete version of one of the many potential pipelines that I felt I was making progress. Moreover, once I knew those software packages inside and out, it was much easier to understand why others might be better or worse for my data.

Of course, if you are replicating the results from an existing paper, this step is a little easier - just follow the pipeline described in that paper’s methods.
