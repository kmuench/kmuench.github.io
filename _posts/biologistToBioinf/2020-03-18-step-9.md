There will almost certainly be a point at which you come perilously close to chucking your computer out the nearest window.

This is normal! Feeling extremely frustrated does not mean you will hate coding forever, or that you are a bad coder. In fact, frustration means that you are truly giving your new bioinformatics muscles a thorough workout, and you are well on your way to becoming stronger. 

But just as a good workout requires a recovery period, effective computational biology require rest as well. It is imperative that you learn how to identify and work around frustration if you are going to acquire bioinformatics as a skill.

If you feel frustrated, try these steps.
1.	Take a quick break. Grab a coffee, have a snack, clear your mind.
2.	If you still feel frustrated, break the problem down into manageable chunks. If the chunks still feel overwhelming, break it down some more. Repeat. The manageable chunk you eventually identify may be very, very small, like Googling the definition of “multiplexing”. Every brick counts when you’re building a palace!
3.	If you need to, ask for help.
4.	If you’re still stuck and feeling lost, take a scientific break. Make a list of side projects you can work on that will make you feel productive. Do you have a list of gene hits you’ve been meaning to read about online? Is there something completely unrelated to bioinformatics you can knock out to feel productive, like a PCR? Can you take a few days off to do a different bench experiment? A week?
5.	Practice self compassion. Remind yourself how much progress you’ve already made. What can you do today that you weren’t able to do when you started? Even small tasks like importing a file can represent big achievements when you are first starting out.

Sometimes it helps to pick a step, set a timer, and devote yourself completely to one of these steps. Give yourself permission to forget about bioinformatics entirely. If you still feel miserable and hopeless every time you sit down to think about code, then you should consider changing your strategy.
