## STEP SEVEN: Do the vignettes
Software packages often come with vignettes. You may be so eager to work on your project that you will skip the vignette and slap the new tool onto your own data.

This is a mistake. It is a mistake I still make today. Listen: I regret it EVERY. TIME. The vignettes are designed to teach you how to play with the tool and understand all of the ways it can help you. More importantly, doing the vignette will show you if your code’s problems are due to a software issue. It’s better to figure out sooner rather than later that a technique is buggy and under-supported.
